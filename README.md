Matrix Operations and File Management

This project is designed to handle a comprehensive set of operations on matrices, as well as provide robust file management capabilities for saving and extracting matrix data. Below is an overview of the features and functionality included in the project:

Features

Union: Combines two matrices to form a new matrix that includes all unique elements from both matrices.
Intersection: Generates a new matrix containing only the elements that are present in both input matrices.
Difference: Creates a matrix consisting of elements that are present in one matrix but not in the other.
Power Set: Computes the power set of a matrix, which is the set of all subsets of the matrix.
Complement: Determines the complement of a matrix relative to a universal set, containing elements not in the original matrix.
Equality Checks: Compares two matrices to check if they are equal in terms of their elements and structure.
Cardinality: Calculates the number of elements in a matrix.
File Management

Saving Data: Provides functionality to save matrix data into a file, ensuring data persistence and easy access for future use.
Extracting Data: Supports extracting matrix data from files, enabling the loading of pre-existing data for analysis or further operations.
Usage
This project is ideal for applications that require complex matrix manipulations and need to manage data through file operations. It can be used in fields such as mathematics, computer science, data analysis, and any area where matrix operations are essential.
